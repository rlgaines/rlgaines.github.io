										<h2 class="major">Summary</h2>
										<p>I am a JavaScript Full Stack (MEAN) developer based in Denver, CO. With a B.S. from Olivet Nazarene University in Business Administration with a focus on Management and Entrepreneurship. I spent the first part of my professional career starting my own Real Estate company in the Greater Denver Area. After tapping into my curiosity of coding web apps, I found a new passion in murdering code, and enrolled into Galvanize's Full Stack program to further pursue developing in a more immerse and professional setting.</p>

										<p>Throughout the program I've developed core competencies in the following technologies: 
										JavaScript, HTML, CSS, AngularJS, Express, jQuery, PostgreSQL, Mocha/Chai/Jasmine testing, Knex and more.</p>

										<p>You can always find me outside on my free time hiking, paddle boarding, or finding a new great place to eat. Also, it is not that hard to convince me to go grab a beer. Just Saying.</p>

											<p>Imprints is a hyperlocal guest book application that allows you to create a new guest book at any location that may be of interest to you. Other users can see where you have gone and written your imprint at, but they cannot write in that guest book unless they are exactly within geolocation of the guest book. This allows users to experience honest impressions of new places and entice them to go explore new guest books.</p>
